"""Declarative test topology builder for multi-host scenarios.

Provides a fluent builder API for defining test topologies with multiple
relay hosts connected to a single router. Simplifies test setup and cleanup
with context manager support.

Example:
    topology = (TestTopology()
        .machiner(rust_router_bin)
        .host("master-a", rust_host_bin, [plugin1, plugin2])
        .host("master-b", swift_host_bin, [plugin3])
        .build())

    with topology:
        reader, writer = topology.start()
        # ... test code using standard frame helpers ...
        # automatic cleanup on exit
